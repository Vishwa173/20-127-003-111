# University Timetable Generator
### Fair & Constrained Timetable + Room Assignment using Advanced Graph Coloring

A sophisticated timetable scheduling system that leverages graph theory algorithms to generate conflict-free course schedules with optimal room assignments while maintaining equitable distribution across time slots.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive university timetabling solution that:
- Assigns time slots to courses while avoiding student conflicts
- Matches rooms to courses based on capacity and equipment requirements
- Balances course load across time slots for fairness
- Respects instructor availability and pre-assigned constraints

Built on three fundamental graph theory theorems with practical algorithmic implementations.

## 🔬 Theoretical Foundation

### 1. *Brooks' Theorem*
*Statement*: Every connected graph with maximum degree Δ has chromatic number χ(G) ≤ Δ, except for complete graphs and odd cycles.

*Application*: Provides a theoretical lower bound for the minimum number of time slots needed. We compute the maximum degree (Δ) of the conflict graph and use it to validate our coloring results.

### 2. *Vizing Theorem (Equitable Coloring)*
*Statement*: Every graph with maximum degree Δ is equitably k-colorable for k ≥ Δ + 1, meaning color classes differ in size by at most 1.

*Application*: Ensures balanced distribution of courses across time slots, preventing overloaded schedules and maintaining fairness for students and faculty.

### 3. *Hall's Marriage Theorem*
*Statement*: A bipartite graph has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset S of one vertex set, |N(S)| ≥ |S|.

*Application*: Used to assign rooms to courses within each time slot. We model courses and rooms as a bipartite graph and find maximum matchings respecting capacity and equipment constraints.

## 🏗 System Architecture

### Graph Modeling

*Conflict Graph G = (V, E)*
- *Vertices (V)*: Courses
- *Edges (E)*: Connect courses that share at least one student (conflict)
- *Vertex Attributes*:
  - allowedSlots: List of permitted time slots (instructor availability)
  - enrollment: Number of students
  - equipment: Required equipment set
  - instructor: Faculty member teaching the course

*Bipartite Graph B_t = (C_t, R)*
- *Left vertices (C_t)*: Courses assigned to time slot t
- *Right vertices (R)*: Available rooms
- *Edges*: Connect course c to room r if capacity and equipment constraints are satisfied

### Algorithms Implemented

#### 1. DSATUR (Degree of Saturation) Algorithm
- *Purpose*: Graph coloring with list constraints
- *Strategy*: Greedily colors vertices based on saturation degree
- *Features*:
  - Respects list coloring (instructor availability)
  - Handles pre-colored vertices (fixed assignments)
  - O(n²) time complexity
  
*Pseudocode*:

1. Color vertex with highest degree using first available color from its list
2. While uncolored vertices exist:
   a. Select vertex v with maximum saturation (or max degree as tiebreaker)
   b. Assign smallest color not used by neighbors and in v's allowed list
   c. Update saturation of v's neighbors


#### 2. Bipartite Matching (Augmenting Path)
- *Purpose*: Room assignment
- *Strategy*: Finds maximum matching using DFS-based augmenting paths
- *Constraints*: 
  - Room capacity ≥ course enrollment
  - Room has all required equipment
- *Time Complexity*: O(VE) where V = courses, E = rooms

*Pseudocode*:

For each course c in time slot t:
  1. DFS to find augmenting path from c to an unmatched room
  2. If found, update matching
  3. If no path exists, course remains unassigned (Hall condition violated)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

### Feasibility Metrics
- *Slots Used*: Number of time slots required
- *Brooks Bound Check*: Whether slots ≤ Δ + 1
- *Unassigned Courses*: Courses without rooms (Hall condition violations)

### Quality Metrics
- *Equitable Distribution*:
  - Max courses per slot
  - Min courses per slot
  - Imbalance = Max - Min (ideal: 0 or 1)
  
- *Room Utilization*: (Total students) / (Total capacity) × 100%
- *Computation Time*: Algorithm runtime in milliseconds

### Theoretical vs Practical
- *Lower Bound (χ(G))*: ω(G) ≤ χ(G) ≤ Δ + 1
  - ω(G) = size of maximum clique
  - Δ = maximum degree
- *Equitable Bound*: k ≥ Δ + 1 guarantees equitable k-coloring
